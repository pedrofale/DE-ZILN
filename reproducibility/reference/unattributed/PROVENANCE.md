# Unattributed reference data

`X.npy` and `Y.npy`, 12 MB each, moved here from `simul/test/NB_t_test_data/`
during the 2026-09-10 restructure.

**What is known.** Nothing in the repository reads them: a grep for `.npy`
across every tracked file returns zero hits, and `decision-repo-restructure`
independently recorded the same thing ("24 MB ... which no script in the tree
reads"). They are the only tracked files with no reader and no writer.

**What is guessed, and should not be relied on.** Their per-gene means are
around 100, which is consistent with `main_rSEQ.tex`'s "Densely Expressed Gene
Data" section (`\label{sec:dense_nb}`): mu_Y = 100, phi_Y = 0.1, mu_X = 100 + h
with h ~ N(15, 25), phi_X varying over {0.1, 0.2, 1.0}. That section produces
`figures/NB_experiments/dense_nb_lfcs.png`. The match is by parameter plausibility
only -- no code links the arrays to that figure, and no commit message does either.

**Why they are here rather than deleted.** Under Pedro's 2026-09-10 criterion a
file is deleted only if we are certain it did not contribute to a manuscript
result, or if it is duplicated code. Neither holds: the parameter match is
evidence *for* contribution, not against, and there is no duplicate.

**Open question for Oskar.** What produced these, and do they underlie
`dense_nb_lfcs.png`? If yes they are an input worth a generator; if no they are
24 MB of dead weight and `decision-data-out-of-head` can drop them without a
Zenodo deposit. Recorded in `handoff-math-questions` alongside question 5.
