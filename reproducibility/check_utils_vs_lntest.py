"""Measure what substituting ``lntest``'s estimator for ``utils.py``'s does to each arm.

``utils.py`` and ``lntest`` are not two copies of one estimator. They differ in
the trigamma term of the standard error -- ``utils.trigamma(x) = 1/x`` against
``lntest.trigamma_diff_int(a, n) = sum_{j=a..n-1} 1/j^2`` -- and every published
RECOMB number came from the approximate one. The log-fold change is untouched by
that difference; the standard error, the t statistic and every p-value are not.

This harness answers the only question that gates the substitution: **does any
arm's headline number move?** It does not fix anything, and it must not be made
to pass. See decision-retire-utils-py, and handoff-math-questions questions 1-2.

Two gates
---------
**Hard.** ``max|dLFC| < 1e-5`` on every measured arm. The LFC involves no
trigamma, so the only difference expected there is ``utils``'s float32
intermediates. Anything larger means something other than the trigamma term
changed, and the run is a failure, not a finding.

**Soft.** Significance-call disagreements at alpha = 0.05 are *expected* to be
nonzero. They are reported, never failed on. A clean zero here would be evidence
this harness is wrong, not that the substitution is safe.

**If a headline number moves, stop.** That is a manuscript change and it goes to
Oskar. Do not soften, round, or average a difference away to get past this.

Exit codes
----------
``0`` both gates pass. ``2`` an arm was not measured, or was measured only in
part, so no verdict is available for it -- this includes any arm standing on an
argument rather than a measurement. ``3`` the hard gate failed. ``4`` a headline
number moved -- stop, and take it to Oskar. ``5`` an API assertion failed, so
the surface stage 3b rewires is not the one measured here. Nonzero is the normal
outcome of an incomplete run; it is never a reason to relax a gate.

Usage
-----
    python check_utils_vs_lntest.py --arm all --json report.json

Requires ``lntest`` importable (``pip install -e .`` at the repo root, or the
``de-ziln-reproducibility`` conda env). The comparison is deliberately against
the *installed* package, not ``pkg/``, because the published package is what the
refactor puts behind every arm.

# Arm adapters -- stage 1b-ii
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Each adapter transcribes one arm script's input generation line for line: the
# same seed, the same draw order, the same filtering. The scripts cannot be
# imported -- they are top-level code that calls plt.show() and writes to
# hardcoded paths on other people's machines -- so transcription is the only way
# to put both estimators on an arm's real inputs, and it is the single place
# this harness is most able to be quietly wrong. Read each adapter against its
# script; that is what this commit is for.
#
# Four things are deliberately *not* transcribed.
#
#   * The scanpy and wilcoxon baselines, which neither estimator touches. That
#     is safe only if they consume no numpy randomness, because every arm
#     interleaves them with the next replicate's draws --
#     check_baseline_rng_neutrality() is that precondition, checked rather than
#     assumed, and fatal if it fails.
#   * The plotting, the per-replicate CSV dumps and the results CSVs, none of
#     which feed a number.
#   * Arm C's per-replicate AnnData copy and densification, which are identical
#     in every replicate and consume no randomness. Nothing in the loop writes
#     to the dense matrix, so they are hoisted out of it.
#   * Arm B's `method` loop, which rebinds `method` to "Scanpy t-test" inside
#     itself. Only its LN branch is transcribed.
#
# --reps evaluates a prefix of the replicates but *always performs every draw*,
# so a reduced run sees exactly the inputs the full run's first replicates see
# rather than a differently-seeded stream. Arm B is the exception worth naming:
# its replicate loop is nested inside a dispersion loop, so a truncated run is a
# true prefix of the full run only within each dispersion block, and the blocks
# themselves stay aligned only because the skipped work is evaluation, not
# drawing. Reduced runs are labelled, and their headline numbers are marked not
# comparable to the manuscript.

    """large_scale_CITE_seq_exp.py -- planted signal on real CITE-seq counts.

    Transcribed from large_scale_CITE_seq_exp.py:29-135. Seed 1, 100 replicates
    over citeseq/data/memory_CD4.h5ad with the MT- genes dropped. Per
    replicate the draw order is the group assignment over all cells, then the
    100 Gaussian log-fold changes, then the 100 gene indices they are applied to.

    Two literal details that would leave the magnitudes right and the sign or the
    filter wrong if lost. This arm calls **get_DELN_lfcs, not get_LN_lfcs**, and
    it calls it as (X_data_filtered, Y_data_filtered) -- so the perturbed
    group_B is the estimator's first argument and the log-fold change runs
    group_B minus group_A. And the detection filter is computed on the
    *unperturbed* group_B counts, X_data_orig, while the estimator is given the
    perturbed X_data_modified.

    decision-retire-utils-py requires the eps = 1e-9 term and the missing
    all-zero-gene guard that separate get_DELN_lfcs from get_LN_lfcs to be
    *shown* inert behind this arm's min_cells_per_group = 3 filter rather than
    assumed inert. So each replicate also runs utils' own get_LN_lfcs on the same
    inputs, with the trigamma held fixed, reported as deln_vs_ln_within_utils
    next to a count of all-zero genes surviving the filter.

    That gap is NOT the eps and the guard, which is what this docstring claimed
    until the numbers came in. Both are provably inert -- the filter guarantees
    n_plus >= 3, so eps ** (1 + n_plus) <= 1e-36, and 0 all-zero genes survive,
    so the guard branch is unreachable. The measured 1.03e-06 is the float32
    intermediates get_LN_lfcs allocates and get_DELN_lfcs does not.
